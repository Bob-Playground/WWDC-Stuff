Hello and welcome to WWDC.

Hi everyone, I’m Ben.

I’m in the **Languages and Runtimes team**, and I’m going to talk to you about changes we’ve made this year in the **Objective-C runtime** in *iOS* and *macOS* that **significantly improve memory use**.

This talk is a little bit different to most.
 
You *shouldn’t need* to change any of your code.

I’m *not* going to talk about any *new APIs* to learn this year or *deprecation warnings* to squash.

**With any luck, you won’t need to do anything and your apps will just get faster.**
 
Why are we telling you about these improvements? Well, partly because we think they’re cool and interesting, but also because **these kind of improvements in the runtime are only possible because our internal data structures are hidden behind APIs**.

When apps access these data structures directly, things get a little crashy.

supported OS versions:  

- macOS Big Sur
- iOS 14
- tvOS 14
- watchOS 7

---

In this talk you’ll learn a few things to watch out for that might happen when someone else working on your codebase, not you obviously, access things that they shouldn’t.

We’re gonna cover **three changes** in this session.

- First, there’s a change in **the data structures that the Objective-C runtime uses to track classes**.
- Then we’ll take a look at changes to **Objective-C method lists**.
- Finally, we’ll look at a change in how **tagged pointers** are represented.

# 1. Class in Memory

So, let’s start off with changes to **the runtime data for classes**.

## class object & class_ro_t

On disk, in your application binary, classes look like this.

First, there’s the **class object** itself, which contains the information that's most frequently accessed: **pointers to the metaclass, superclass, and the method cache**.

**It also has a pointer to more data where additional information is stored**, called the `class_ro_t`. "**ro**" stands for **read only**.

And this includes things like the **class's name** and information about **methods**, **protocols**, and **instance variables**.

*Swift classes* and *Objective-C classes* **share this infrastructure**, so each **Swift class has these data structures as well**.

**When classes are first loaded from disk into memory, they start off like this too, but they change once they're used**.

## Clean memory & Dirty memory

Now, to understand what happens then, it’s useful to know about the difference between **clean memory** and **dirty memory**.

- **Clean memory** is memory that isn’t changed once it’s loaded.
The `class_ro_t` is clean because it’s **read only**.

- **Dirty memory** is memory that’s changed while the process is running.

**For example, it creates a fresh method cache and points to it from the class.**

- **Dirty memory** is much more expensive than clean memory.It has to be kept around for as long as the process is running.

- **Clean memory**, on the other hand, can be evicted to make room for other things because you if you need it, the system can always just reload it from disk.

*macOS* has the option to **swap out** dirty memory, but dirty memory is especially costly in *iOS* because it **doesn’t use swap**.

---

Dirty memory is the reason why this class data is split into two pieces.

The more data that can be kept clean, the better.

By separating out data that never changes, that allows for most of the class data to be kept as clean memory.

This data is enough to get us started, but the runtime needs to track more information about each class.

So, when a class first gets used, the runtime allocates additional storage for it.

This runtime allocated storage is the `class_rw_t`, for **read/write** data.

In this data structure, we **store new information only generated at runtime**.

For example, all classes get linked into a tree structure using these **First Subclass** and **Next Sibling Class** pointers, and **this allows the runtime to traverse all the classes currently in use, which is useful for invalidating method caches**.

---

But why do we have **methods** and **properties** here when they're in the read only data too? 

Well, because **they can be changed at runtime**.

**When a category is loaded, it can add new methods to the class, and the programmer can add them dynamically using runtime APIs.**

Since the `class_ro_t` is read only, we need to track these things in the `class_rw_t`.

Now, it turns out that this takes up quite a bit of memory.

There are a lot of classes in use in any given device.

We measured about **30 megabytes** of these `class_rw_t` structures **across the system on an iPhone**.

---

So, how could we shrink these down? 

Remember we need these things in the **read/write** part because they can be changed at runtime.

But examining usage on real devices, we found that only around **10%** of classes ever **actually have their methods changed**.

And this `demangled` name field is only used by *Swift classes*, and **isn't even needed for Swift classes unless something asks for their Objective-C name**.

So, we can split off the parts that aren't usually used, and this cuts the size of the `class_rw_t` in **half**.

For the classes that do need the additional information, we can allocate one of these **extended records** and slide it in for the class to use.

Approximately **90%** of classes **never need this extended data**, **saving** around **14 megabytes** *system wide*.

This is memory that’s now available for more productive uses, like storing your app’s data.

## Measure: heap memory

So, you can actually see the impact of this change yourself on your Mac by running some simple commands in the terminal.

Let’s take a look at that now.

I'm gonna go into the *terminal* on my *MacBook* here, and I'm gonna run a command that's available on any Mac, called `heap`.

And it lets you inspect the **heap memory** in use by a *running process*.

So, I'm gonna run it against the *Mail app* on my Mac.

Now, if I just ran this, it would output thousands of lines showing every heap allocation made by Mail.

So, instead I'm just gonna `grep` it for the types we've been talking about today, The `class_rw_t` types.

And I'm also gonna search for the *header*.

---

And from the results that come back, we can see that we're using about **9000** of these `class_rw_t` types in the Mail app, but only about **a tenth of them**, a little over **900**, actually needed this **extended information**.

So, we can easily calculate the savings we've made by this change.
This is the type that's **halved** in size.

So, if we subtract from this number the amount of memory we've had to allocate to the **extended types**, we can see that **we've saved about a quarter of a meg of data just for the Mail app**.

**If we extend that system wide, that's a real savings in terms of dirty memory**.

## Don't rely on internal data structures，use APIs

Now, a lot of code that fetches data out of the **class** now has to deal with classes that both do and don't have this extended data.

Of course, the runtime handles all of that for you, and from the outside, everything just keeps working like it always did, just using less memory.

This works because the code that reads these structures is all within the runtime, and it's updated at the same time.

---

Sticking to these APIs is really important because **any code that tried to access these data structures directly is going to stop working in this year's OS release** since things have moved around, and **that code won't know about the new layout**.

We saw some real code that broke due to these changes, and, in addition to your own code, watch out for *external dependencies* you might be bringing into your app that might be digging into these data structures without you realizing.

All of the information in these structures is available through official APIs.

There are functions like `class_getName` and `class_getSuperclass`.

When you use these APIs to access this information, you know they'll keep working no matter what we change behind the scenes.

All of these APIs can be found in the *Objective-C runtime documentation* on *developer.apple.com*.

# 2. Relative Method Lists

Next, let's dive a little deeper into these class data structures and take a look at another change, **relative method lists**.

Every class has a list of methods attached to it.

When you write a new method on a class, it gets added to the list.

**The runtime uses these lists to resolve message sends.**

## Method structure

Each method contains three pieces of information.

- First is the **method's name** or **selector**.

**Selectors are strings**, but **they're unique so they can be compared using pointer equality**.

- Next is the **method's type encoding**.

This is a string that represents the **parameter** and **return types**, and it **isn't used for sending messages**, but it's **needed for things like runtime introspection and message forwarding**.

- Finally, there's a pointer to the **method's implementation**, The actual code for the method.

When you write a method, it gets **compiled into a C function with your implementation** in it, and then the entry in the method list points to that function.

Let's look at a single method.

---

I've chosen the `init` method.

It contains entries for the **method name**, **types**, and **implementation**.

**Each piece of data in the method list is a pointer.**

On our **64-bit** systems, that means that each **method table entry** occupies **24 bytes**.

Now this is **clean memory**, but clean memory isn't free.

**It still has to be loaded from disk and occupies memory when it's in use.**

Now here's a zoomed out view of the memory within a process.

Note that it's not to scale.

There's this big address space that requires 64 bits to address.

Within that address space, various pieces are carved out for the **stack**, the **heap**, and the **executables** and **libraries** or **binary images** *loaded* into the *process*, shown here in *blue*.

## Method List in Binary Images

Let's zoom in and look at one of these **binary images**.

Here, we show the three **method table entries** pointing into locations in their binary.

This shows us another cost.

A **binary image** can be **loaded anywhere in memory** depending on where the **dynamic linker** decides to place it.

That means that the **linker** needs to **resolve the pointers into the image and fix them up to point to their actual location in memory at load time**, and that also has a cost.

**Now note that a class method entry from a binary only ever points to method implementations within that binary.**

There's no way to make a method that has its metadata in one binary and the code implementing it in another.
That means that method list entries don't actually need to be able to refer to the entire **64-bit** address space.

**They only ever need to be able to refer to functions within their own binary, and those will always be nearby.**

So, instead of an absolute **64-bit** address, they can use a **32-bit** *relative offset within the binary*.

And that's a change that we've made this year.

## Advantages of Relative Method Lists 

This has several advantages.

- Firstly, **the offsets are always the same no matter where the image is loaded into memory**, so they don't have to be fixed up after they're loaded from disk.

- And **because they don't need to be fixed up, they can be held in true read only memory, which is more secure**.

- And, of course, **32-bit** offsets mean that we've **halved the amount of memory** needed on **64-bit** platforms.

We've measured about **80MB** of these methods **system wide** on a typical iPhone.

Since they're **half** the size, we **save 40 megabytes**.

That's more memory your app can use to delight your users.

## Swizzling for Relative Method Lists

But what about **swizzling**? 

The **method lists** in a **binary** can't now refer to the full address space, but if you swizzle a method, that can be implemented anywhere.

And besides, we just said that we want to keep these method lists **read only**.

To handle this, we also have **a global table mapping methods to their swizzled implementations**.

Swizzling is rare.

The vast majority of methods never actually get swizzled, so this table doesn't end up getting very big.

Even better, the table is compact.
 
**Memory is dirtied a page at a time.**

- With the old style of method lists, swizzling a method would dirty the entire page it was on, resulting in many kilobytes of dirty memory for a single swizzle.

- With the table, we just pay the cost for an extra table entry.

As always, these changes are invisible to you, and everything keeps working just like it always has.

These **relative method lists** are supported on the new OS versions coming out later this year.

## Deployment Target

When you build with the corresponding minimum deployment target, the tools will automatically generate relative method lists in your binaries.

If you need to target older OS versions still, not to worry. Xcode will generate the old style method list format as well, which is still fully supported.

You still get the benefit from the OS itself being built with the new **relative method lists**, and the system has no problem with both formats in use in the same app at the same time.

If you can target this year's OS releases though, you'll get **smaller binaries** and **less memory usage**. This is a generally good tip in *Objective-C* or *Swift*.

Minimum deployment targets aren't just about which SDK APIs are available to you.

**When Xcode knows that it doesn't need to support older OS versions, it can often emit better optimized code or data.**

We understand that many of you need to support older OS versions, but this is a reason why it's a good idea to increase your deployment target whenever you can.

## Mismatched deployment targets

Now, **one thing to watch out for is building with a deployment target that's newer than the one you intend it to target, Xcode usually prevents this, but it can slip through, especially if you're building your own libraries or frameworks elsewhere and then bringing them in**.

When running on an older OS, that **older runtime will see these relative methods, but it doesn't know anything about them, so it will try to interpret them like the old style pointer-based methods**.

That means **it will try to read a pair of 32-bit fields as a 64-bit pointer**.

**The result is two integers being glued together as a pointer**, which is **a nonsense value** that is certain to **crash** if it's actually used.

You can recognize when this happens by a crash in the runtime reading method information, where the bad pointer looks like **two 32-bit values smooshed together** as in this example.

## Don't rely on internal data structures，use APIs

And if you're running code that digs through these structures to read out the values, that code will have the same problem as these older runtimes, and the app would crash when users upgraded their devices.

So again, don't do that. Use the APIs.

Those APIs keep working regardless of how things change underneath.

For example, there are functions that, given a method pointer, return the values for its fields.

# 3. Presentation Changes of Tagged Pointer on ARM64

Let's explore one more change coming this year.

A change to the **tagged pointer** format on **arm64**.

---

First, we need to know what **tagged pointers** are.

We're gonna get really low-level here, but don't worry.

Like everything else we've talked about, you don't need to know this.

It's just interesting, and maybe helps you understand your *memory usage* a little better.

## About *Normal Object Pointer*
 
Let's start by looking at the structure of a **normal object pointer**.

Typically when we see these, they're printed as these big **hexadecimal** numbers.

We saw some of these earlier.

Let's break it out into the **binary representation**.

We have **64 bits**, however, we don't really use all of these bits.

only these bits here in the middle are ever set in a **real object pointer**.

- The **low bits** are **always zero because of alignment requirements. objects must always be located at an address that's a multiple of the pointer size**.

- The **high bits** are **always zero because the address space is limited**. we don't actually go all the way up to two to the **64** (2^64).

**These high and low bits are always zero.**

## Tagged Pointer on *Intel* Platform

So, let's pick one of these bits that's always zero and make it a one.

That can immediately tell us that this is *not* a **real object pointer**, and then we can assign some other meaning to all of the other bits.

We call this a **tagged pointer**.

For example, we might stuff a numeric value into the other bits.

As long as we were to teach `NSNumber` how to read those *bits*, and teach the *runtime* to handle the **tagged pointers** appropriately, the rest of the system can treat these things like object pointers and never know the difference.

And this saves us the overhead of allocating a **tiny number object** for every case like this, which can be a significant win.

Tagged Pointer's value is obfuscated. Just a quick aside, these values are actually **obfuscated by combining them with a randomized value that's initialized at process startup**. 
This is a **security measure** that **makes it difficult to forge a tagged pointer**.

We'll ignore this for the rest of the discussion, since it's just an extra layer on top. Just be aware that if you actually try and look at these values in memory, they'll be scrambled.

So, this is the full format of a tagged pointer on **Intel**. The low bit is set to **one** to indicate that this is a **tagged pointer**.

---

As we discussed, this bit must always be **zero** for a **real pointer**, so this allows us to tell them apart.

The **next three bits** are the **tag number**. This indicates the type of the **tagged pointer**.

For example, a **three**(*0B011*) means it's an `NSNumber`, a **six**(*0B110*), that it's an `NSDate`.

Since we have **three tag bits**, there are **eight possible tag types**.

The rest of the bits are the **payload**.
 This is data that the particular type can use however it likes. For a **tagged NSNumber**, this is the actual number.

Now, there's a **special case** for tag **seven**. This indicates an **extended tag**.

An **extended tag** uses the **next eight bits** to encode the type, allowing for **256 more tag types** at the cost of a smaller *payload*.

This allows us to use **tagged pointers** for more types, as long as they can fit their data into a smaller space.

This gets used for things like **tagged UI colors** or **NSIndexSets**.

## Tagged Pointer in *Swift*

Now, if this seems really handy to you, you might be disappointed to hear that **only the runtime maintainer, that is Apple, can add tagged pointer types**. 
**But if you're a Swift programmer, you'll be happy to know that you can create your own kinds of tagged pointers.**

If you've ever used **an enum with an associated value that's a class, that's like a tagged pointer**.

The *Swift runtime* **stores the enum discriminator in the spare bits of the associated value payload**.

What's more, **Swift's use of value types actually makes tagged pointers less important, because values no longer need to be exactly pointer sized**.

For example, a **Swift UUID type** can be two words and held **inline** instead of allocating a separate object because it doesn't fit inside a pointer.

Now that's tagged pointers on *Intel*.

## Tagged Pointer on *ARM64* Platform

Let's have a look at **ARM**.

### iOS 13 and Before

On **arm64**, we've *flipped* things around.

Instead of the *bottom bit*, the *top bit* is set to **one** to indicate a **tagged pointer**.

Then the **tag number** comes in the **next three bits**, and then the **payload** uses the remaining bits.

Why do we use the *top bit* to indicate a **tagged pointer** on **ARM**, instead of the *bottom bit* like we do on *Intel*? Well, it's actually **a tiny optimization** for `objc_msgSend`.

We want the most common path in `msgSend` to be as fast as possible, and **the most common path is for a normal pointer**.

**We have two less common cases: tagged pointers and nil.**

It turns out that when we use the *top bit*, we can check for both of those with a single comparison, and this saves a *conditional branch* for the common case in `msgSend` compared to checking for **nil** and **tagged pointers** separately.

Just like in *Intel*, we have a special case for tag **seven**, where the **next eight bits** are used as an **extended tag**, and then the remaining bits are used for the **payload**.

Or that was actually the old format used in *iOS 13*.

### `iOS 14`'s Change

In this year's release, we're moving things around a bit.

The **tag bit** stays at the top, because that **msgSend optimization** is still really useful.

The **tag number** now moves to the **bottom three bits**.

The **extended tag**, if in use, occupies the **high eight bits** following the tag bit.

Why did we do this? 

Well, let's consider a **normal pointer** again.

Our existing tools, like the **dynamic linker**, ignore the top eight bits of a pointer due to an **ARM feature** called **Top Byte Ignore**, and we'll put the **extended tag** in the **Top Byte Ignore bits**.

For an **aligned pointer**, the **bottom three bits** are always zero, but we can fiddle with that just by adding a small number to the pointer.

We'll add **seven** to set the **low bits** to one.

Remember, **seven** is the indication that this is an extended tag.

And that means we can actually fit this pointer above into an extended tag pointer payload.

The result is a tagged pointer with a normal pointer in its payload. 
Why is that useful? 

Well, **it opens up the ability for a tagged pointer to refer to constant data** in your binary such as **strings** or other data structures that would otherwise have to occupy **dirty memory**.

## Don't rely on internal data structures，use APIs

Now, of course, these changes mean that code, which accesses these bits directly, will no longer work when iOS 14 is released later this year.

A bitwise check like this would've worked in the past, but it'll give you the wrong answer on future OSs, and your app will start mysteriously corrupting user data.

So, don't use code that relies on anything we've just talked about.

Instead, you can probably guess what I'm gonna say, which is use the APIs.

Type checks like `isKindOfClass` worked on the **old tagged pointer format**, and they'll continue to work on the **new tagged pointer format**.

All `NSString` or `NSNumber` methods just keep on working.

All of the information in these **tagged pointers** can be retrieved through the standard APIs.

It's worth noting this also applies to **CF types** as well.

We don't want to hide anything and we definitely don't want to break anybody's apps.

When these details aren't exposed, it's just because we need to maintain the flexibility to make changes like this, and your apps will keep working just fine, as long as they *don't* rely on these **internal details**.

# Summary

So, let's wrap up.

In this talk, we've seen a few of the *behind-the-scenes* improvements that have shrunk the overhead of our runtime, leaving more memory available to you and your users.

You get these improvements *without* having to do anything except, maybe, consider raising your deployment target.

To help us make these improvements each year, just follow a simple rule.

**Don't read internal bits directly. Use the APIs.**

Thanks for watching, and enjoy your faster devices.
